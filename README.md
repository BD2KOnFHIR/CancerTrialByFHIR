Cancer Clinical Trials Using HL7 FHIR Resources
===============================================

Case report forms (CRFs) are the questionnaires to collect information for a study.  The objective of this model is to represent the extracted common data elements from CRFS with the help of HL7 FHIR Resources and Profiles. The Logical model here represents the Australian Colorectal Cancer FHIR Profile.
