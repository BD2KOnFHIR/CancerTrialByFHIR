Cancer Clinical Trials Using HL7 FHIR Resources
===============================================

Case report forms (CRFs) are the questionnaires to collect information for a study.  The objective of this model is to represent the extracted common data elements from CRFS with the help of HL7 FHIR Resources and Profiles. The Logical model here represents the Australian Colorectal Cancer FHIR Profile.

### [CRF Model](model)

The CRF Model is a [UML Model](model) created using MagicDraw UML Editor.  To view the UML Model above and all other supporting model element, it is recommended to view that in [NoMagic MagicDraw](https://www.nomagic.com/products/magicdraw) 18.1 FR (or newer version).  In absence of MagicDraw Editor, once can open this using [Sparx Enterprise Architect](https://sparxsystems.com/products/ea/index.html) (by importing the .mdzip archive provided here).  The model follows UML 2.5 specifications.

### Model Usage

This model can be used to share information with other modeler as a UML model is implementation independent. This model can be extended with additional classes and properties to make it more useful to the target domain model.  This model can also be embedded in a user UML model as a resource.  Any UML Editor like No Magic's MagicDraw, Sparx Enterprise Architect can be used.

MDD (Model Driven Development) - This model can also be used to generate development templates (in Java and C++). To get started with application development,
We recommend a tool like [Papyrus - for Eclipse ](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/).
